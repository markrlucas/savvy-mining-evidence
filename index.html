    <h1>Savvy Mining Evidence – Scam Warning</h1>
    <p>Documented timeline of blocked withdrawals and hidden “VIP clause”</p>
  </header>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I invested <strong>34,000 XRP</strong> with Savvy Mining after reading about it on TradingView. 
        At first, I was able to withdraw my initial capital from small 5 day contracts. 
        However, after investing larger amounts, my account was automatically upgraded to 
        <strong>VIP status</strong>, which triggered a "hidden clause" requiring me to purchase 
        <strong>10 contracts of the same type (up to $500,000 of the $50,000)</strong> before I could withdraw again.
      </p>
      <p class="warning">
        My account is now restricted. Withdrawals fail with the message: 
        “You have not fulfilled the terms of the contract.”  
        This is a classic crypto scam tactic. This has all the markings of a scam.

      <h2>Timeline of Evidence</h2>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>1. Completed Early Contracts (Withdrawals Worked)</h3>
        <p>On 2025-08-02, I invested in multiple small 5-day contracts ($5,000 each). Both completed successfully and allowed withdrawals.</p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>2. Larger Contracts Trigger VIP Clause</h3>
        <p>The VIP contract is placed on the bottom of the "advanced computing power contract", given one had already invested a considerable amount. This clause is triggered, This page shows the hidden "Friendly reminder" rule: “You must purchase 10 of these contracts consecutively, or 10 contracts of equal value, before the contract sells out.” One cannot tell if this is injected into the contract one increases in VIP status. However, this was never disclosed before upgrading to VIP.</p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>3. Running Contracts (Funds Locked)</h3>
        <p>Three contracts (25-day $30k, 25-day $35k, 45-day $50k) are still running. Despite their maturity periods, withdrawals are blocked due to the VIP clause.</p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>4. Failed Withdrawals</h3>
        <p>Multiple withdrawal attempts (Aug 17–18, 2025) failed with the message: “You have not fulfilled the terms of the contract. Please complete the terms promptly.”</p>

      </div>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>5. Main Dashboard (Totals & VIP Level)</h3>
        <p>The dashboard shows: Total Deposits = 113,335.5 USDT (~34,000 XRP), Total Withdrawals = 25,238.5 USDT, Active Orders = 3, and VIP4 status.</p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <h3>6. Non-VIP Contract Page (No Clause)</h3>
        <p>For smaller contracts, there is no mention of any continuous purchase requirement. This proves the VIP clause is hidden until larger deposits are made.</p>

      <h2>Analysis of Red Flags</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Hidden “VIP clause” forces you to keep depositing with no cap.</li>
        <li>❌ Withdrawals blocked once deposits became substantial.</li>
        <li>❌ Generic support replies with no resolution.</li>
        <li>❌ Contradicts their public claim of “transparent and open contracts.”</li>
      </ul>
